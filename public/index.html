      <h1>Journaling for Mental Health</h1>
      <p class="lede">
        When you were a teenager, you might have kept a diary hidden under your
        mattress. It was a place to confess your struggles and fears without
        judgment or punishment. It likely felt good to get all of those thoughts
        and feelings out of your head and down on paper. The world seemed
        clearer.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may have stopped using a diary once you reached adulthood. But the
        concept and its benefits still apply. Now it's called journaling. It's
        simply writing down your thoughts and feelings to understand them more
        clearly. And if you struggle with stress, depression, or anxiety,
        keeping a journal can be a great idea. It can help you gain control of
        your emotions and improve your mental health.
      </p>
      <h2>Journaling benefits</h2>
      <p>
        One of the ways to deal with any overwhelming emotion is to find a
        healthy way to express yourself. This makes a journal a helpful tool in
        managing your mental health. Journaling can help you:
      </p>
      <ul>

          <p>Reduce stress</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cope with depression</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Journaling helps control your symptoms and improve your mood by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Helping you prioritize problems, fears, and concerns</p>
        </li>
        <li>

            and learn ways to better control them

            negative thoughts and behaviors
          </p>

        you identify what's causing that stress or anxiety. Once you've

        problems and reduce your stress.

      <h2>How to journal</h2>
      <p>Try these tips to help you get started with journaling:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Try to write every day. </strong>Set aside a few minutes
            every day to write. This will help you to write in your journal
            regularly.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Make it easy.</strong> Keep a pen and paper handy at all
            times. Then when you want to write down your thoughts, you can. You
            can also keep a journal on your smartphone.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Write or draw whatever feels right. </strong> Your journal
            doesn't need to follow any certain structure. It's your own private
            place to discuss and create whatever you want to express your
            feelings. Let the words and ideas flow freely. Don't worry about
            spelling mistakes or what other people might think.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Use your journal as you see fit. </strong> You don't have to
            share your journal with anyone. If you do want to share some of your
            thoughts with trusted friends and loved ones, you could show them
            parts of your journal.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Keeping a journal helps you create order when your world feels like it's
        in chaos. You get to know yourself by revealing your most private fears,
        thoughts, and feelings. Look at your writing time as personal relaxation
        time. It's a time when you can de-stress and wind down. Write in a place
        that's relaxing and soothing, maybe with a cup of tea. Look forward to
        your journaling time. And know that you're doing something good for your
        mind and body.
